## Objectives

- List popular languages for data science
- List commonly used libraries by data scientists
- Present a table of data science tools

## Popular Languages for Data Science

Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use include:
- Python
- R
- SQL
- Julia

## Commonly Used Libraries

Some of the commonly used libraries by Data Scientists include:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Data Science Tools

- Jupyter Notebook
- RStudio
- Spyder

## Examples

Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:

```python
# This a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print(result)  # Output: 17

# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
hours = 200 / 60
print(hours)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335
